# ASMS 2018 R Workshop Information and Materials

## Workshop Information

**Workshop**: Using R for Mass Spectrometry Data Analysis and Workflows

**Date**: Wednesday June 6 2018, 5:45 â€” 7:00 PM

**Location**: San Diego Convention Center, Room 14 AB

**Description:**

This workshop will focus on the various ways that R can be used for mass spectrometry data processing and analysis. An overview of several R packages for mass spectrometry data access and analysis will be shown, along with example workflows going from raw MS data all the way to data analysis and final analysis reports. Time will also be given for questions and input from the participants. The goal of the workshop is to provide a foundation for anyone to access and analyze their own mass spectrometry data and help broaden analysis possibilities beyond canned routines in existing software packages.
